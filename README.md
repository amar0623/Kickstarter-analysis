# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are analyzing the data of over 4,000 kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to look for trends in the data to see if there are specific factors that affect the kickstarter campaigns success or failure.
